## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Although it is a simple project, it helped me to learn the use of picture, which before I only used img. picture allows you to display different images in a responsive layout, without the need of Media Queries.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture>
    <source media="(min-width:1000px)" srcset="./assets/image-hero-desktop.png">
    <source media="(min-width: 501px)" srcset="./assets/image-hero-tablet.png">
    <img src="./assets/image-hero-mobile.png" alt="girl with coffe">
</picture>
```

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [HTML picture Tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_picture.asp) - This helped my to discover the picture tag.
- [Flexbox playground](https://codepen.io/enxaneta/full/adLPwv/) - Amazing site to learn and try everything about Flexbox Layouts.
